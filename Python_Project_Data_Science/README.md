# Stock Data Analysis and Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

In this project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist/Data Analyst for a new startup investment firm that aids customers in investing their money in stocks. The primary objective is to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reportings, from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping. The stocks under consideration are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

Once the data is collected, the next step is to visualize it in a dashboard to identify any patterns or trends that might be emerging. This will aid in making more informed investment decisions.

## Dashboard Analytics

A well-designed dashboard provides a concise view of key performance indicators in a clear and intuitive manner. In this project, we aim to:

- Analyze the given data set and extract key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Learn to access and display these KPIs in a dashboard format.
- Utilize Plotly for data visualization.

## Tools Used

- **Skills Network Labs**: This is a sandbox environment designed for hands-on learning and lab completion in courses.
- **Watson Studio**: A component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, Watson Studio provides a suite of tools in a collaborative environment. It's designed for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy projects.

## Review Criteria

This project encompasses:

1. Two hands-on labs on extracting stock data.
2. One assignment for evaluation.

The assessment is based on:

- Two quizzes, which are centered around the outcomes of the hands-on labs.
- One peer review assignment, where we share and take screenshots of the project outcomes.
