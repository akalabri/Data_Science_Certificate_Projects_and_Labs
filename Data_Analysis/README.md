### Module 1: Understanding and Importing Data

During this module, I delved into understanding data and used various Python libraries to import data from different sources. I've uploaded my assignments and exploratory analysis for this module.

---

### Module 2: Data Wrangling and Pre-processing

This module was all about data wrangling tasks. From handling missing values to converting categorical variables into numerical ones, I practiced various preprocessing techniques.

---

### Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

I enjoyed exploring data and computing basic statistical information. I applied various methods to understand data distribution and correlation.

---

### Module 4: Regression and Model Evaluation

This module focused on regression techniques. I practiced evaluating data models, implemented polynomial regression, and made predictions using Python.

---

### Module 5: Model Evaluation and Refinement

I learned about the importance of model evaluation and delved into advanced regularization methods. I also explored overfitting, underfitting, and model selection techniques.

---

### Module 6: Final Assignment

In the final assignment, I took on the role of a Data Analyst. I analyzed and predicted market prices based on a given dataset. It was a comprehensive project that encapsulated everything I learned in the course.
