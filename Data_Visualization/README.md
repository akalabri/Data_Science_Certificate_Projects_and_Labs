# Data Visualization with Python
**IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**

## Abstract
In this course, I delved deep into the world of data visualization. A vital tool in the arsenal of data scientists and analysts, data visualization is all about presenting data in a manner that is both comprehensible and visually compelling. Using various visualization tools and techniques, I learned to create graphs and charts that not only convey insights but also tell a compelling story.

The course equipped me with hands-on experience, allowing me to practice and apply a plethora of data visualization techniques using Jupyter Notebooks and a Cloud-based IDE. The Python libraries I got acquainted with include Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly, and Dash.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, I was able to:
- Implement various data visualization techniques using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
- Create a wide array of charts and plots, ranging from line and area plots to histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, and more.
- Generate advanced visualizations like waffle charts, word clouds, regression plots, and maps adorned with markers.
- Construct interactive dashboards with the Dash framework and Plotly library.

## Modules

### 1. Introduction to Data Visualization Tools
This module introduced me to the significance of data visualization, exploring its historical context and the architecture of Matplotlib. Through hands-on labs, I became proficient in creating line plots using Matplotlib and analyzing Canadian immigration data.

### 2. Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
Focusing on the variety of visualization tools available, this module equipped me with the skills to create area plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots using Matplotlib.

### 3. Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data
Diving into advanced visualization techniques, I explored waffle charts, word clouds, and regression plots using Seaborn. The module also introduced me to Folium, enabling me to visualize geospatial data and create captivating maps with markers and Choropleth maps.

### 4. Creating Dashboards with Plotly and Dash
This module provided an in-depth understanding of dashboards and interactive data applications. I learned about the capabilities of Plotly, including the creation of various charts using both Plotly graph objects and Plotly express. The module also introduced me to Dash, illuminating its components and the essence of callback functions.

### 5. Final Project and Exam
In the culmination of the course, I applied the skills acquired throughout the course to analyze historical automobile sales data. This module tasked me with bringing the analysis to life through visualization and presenting the findings on dashboards. The module concluded with a final exam, testing the knowledge I gained.
