# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Machine Learning Course

This README provides a summary of the Machine Learning course offered as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The course consists of several modules covering various aspects of machine learning and its applications.

## Introduction to Machine Learning

In this module, we explored the wide-ranging applications of Machine Learning in diverse industries such as healthcare, finance, telecommunications, and more. Key topics covered include supervised vs. unsupervised learning, the advantages of using Python libraries for implementing ML models, and an overview of ML techniques.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Provide examples of Machine Learning applications across industries.
- Outline the problem-solving steps employed in machine learning.
- Explain various machine learning techniques.
- Describe Python libraries commonly used in Machine Learning.
- Differentiate between Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Understand the capabilities of various machine learning algorithms.

## Regression

The Regression module introduced us to the fundamentals of regression analysis. We delved into concepts like Linear Regression, Non-linear Regression, Simple Regression, and Multiple Regression, along with practical applications. Hands-on labs involved applying these techniques to real datasets and evaluating the accuracy of regression models.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Describe the basics of regression analysis.
- Explain Simple Linear Regression.
- Discuss methods for evaluating regression models.
- Explore evaluation metrics for assessing regression model accuracy.
- Understand Multiple Linear Regression.
- Apply Simple and Multiple Linear Regression to estimate data.

## Classification

This module focused on classification techniques. We gained practical experience with various classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additionally, we learned about the strengths and weaknesses of each method and explored different classification accuracy metrics.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Compare and contrast characteristics of different Classification methods.
- Apply the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- Describe model evaluation metrics.
- Understand decision tree principles and construction.
- Apply Classification algorithms to real-world datasets.
- Explain the construction of regression trees.

## Linear Classification

This module expanded on classification techniques, with a focus on linear classification. Topics included logistic regression, comparison between linear and logistic regression, altering logistic regression model parameters, cost function, gradient descent, and an overview of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and multi-class prediction.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Compare and contrast characteristics of different Classification methods.
- Explain the capabilities of logistic regression.
- Differentiate between linear and logistic regression.
- Modify parameters of a logistic regression model.
- Describe the cost function and gradient descent in logistic regression.
- Provide an overview of Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods.
- Understand multi-class prediction.

## Clustering

In this module, we explored clustering, specifically the K-Means Clustering technique. We learned how K-Means Clustering works and its application in customer segmentation. Additionally, we discussed accuracy concerns related to this clustering method.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Describe the K-Means Clustering technique.
- Understand accuracy considerations for K-Means Clustering.

## Final Project

The final module required us to apply the knowledge gained throughout the course in a project. We built and trained regression and classification models, completed a Jupyter Notebook for the final project, and created a classifier to predict rainfall. Peer evaluation was also a part of this module.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Create a final classification report for evaluation metrics.
- Calculate appropriate evaluation metrics for models.
- Build and train regression and classification models.
- Develop a Jupyter Notebook for the final project.
- Construct a classifier for rain prediction.
- Share the project notebook and a comprehensive project report.
- Evaluate peer projects and provide project grades.
